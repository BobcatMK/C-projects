# Repository description

**1. Standard API Projects**

All projects listed below were written on Linux and have makefile.sh bash script included. Makefile.sh was used for building and running projects. I used clang++ compiler version 3.7.

Projects listed below very often have dependencies to two other projects, it is "test_class" and "helpers", that is why I recommend not separating these projects.

This repository includes following programs:

- **_algorithms_**: implementation of algorithms using functors
- **_array\_with\_templates_**: implementation of array without tests but with exemplary use case
- **_employee\_database\_program_**: Program imitating primitive database. Text file serves as database. You can learn the database structure by reading the exemplary text file included inside the project or by reading source code directly.
- **_helpers_**: set of 3 macros imported by majority of programs included here
- **_linked\_list\_two_way_**: implementation of two way linked list with tests
- **_matrices\_adding\_program_**: simple program that adds two matrices together
- **_queue_**: implementation of queue with tests
- **_stack_**: implementation of stack with tests
- **_test\_class_**: class imported by all above projects, it is used for unit testing (yes, I know it is actually namespace :)).

**2. Windows API Projects**

This part of the repository has three programs written using Visual Studio Community 2015:

- **_Bouncing Ball Simulation_**
It's simulation of boucing ball, to build this project you need access to Windows API.

- **_Open File Dialog_**
this is a primitive text editor, it allows user to load files with .txt extension, edit them and save them. To build this project you need to have access to Windows API
